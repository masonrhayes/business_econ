[:computer: View the code](scripts/bus_econ_hw.jl)

[:notebook: Open the notebook](submission/bus_econ_hw.jl.html)

[:bar_chart: See the graphics](graphics/)

## How to Reproduce

This homework was done in [Julia](https://julialang.org) using the interactive notebook [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl). To simply view the notebook, download [bus_econ_hw.jl.html](submission/bus_econ_hw.jl.html) which is just an HTML file that can be opened in the browser. 

To learn how to run the notebook yourself, you can watch [:tv: this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI) or read [:blue_book: this tutorial](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall20/installation/), which show how to install Julia and start using Pluto.jl.

The notebook is also just a plain Julia file which can be run in your preferred IDE (I recommend [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/)).
